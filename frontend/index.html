**(1)**Login design:
The user enters the website using its login credentials:
IF the username is already stored, it must match the password; ELSE a new
password is required - BOTH username and password are required in order to
play the game. IF the username and password are new, the username is
registered as a new player. By using the join-button, the user will access
the quiz-page section.

The data stored within this section of the app are:

`player_id`, `player_name`, `player_password`. 

The related PostgreSQL Table could have a shape similar to this (with other
columns after):

+-----------------+--------------+------------------+
| player_id(PK)*  | player_name  | player_password  |
+-----------------+--------------+------------------+
| 1               | Alice        | not_1234         |
| 2               | Bob          | not_my_birthday  |
+-----------------+--------------+------------------+
*PK stands for 'primary key'.

**(2)**Quiz Design:
**(2.1)**Frontend:
The user can join a specific room based on the rooms' game states, their
current score, the rooms' categories, IF they are logged in. They cannot join
a room IF they are not logged in: in that case, they will see a "Sorry, you
are not logged in" message.

The room selection interface (for logged users) has this shape:
1) The user sees the message: "Please, choose your preferred category" and
    below a slider with the avilable quiz categories is shown;
2) After the choice, the user is redirected to the relevant room (see below to
    understand the user's and room ranking system);
3) In the room, the user will see the trophy's label and the fields for their
    goals to be reached: 3.1 questions he must write to define the object's
    scopes, 3.2 technical references from the history and techniques of
    philosophy, 3.3 the field for the position of the problem (since this kind
    of content is room-specific and time-specific, it will be served by the
    bakcend).
The submission button is showed at the end of the sequence.

**(2.2)**Level Design:
The rooms are based on a ranking system based on the user's score. There are
5 levels, one for each range of score:

lvl.1 [from 0 to 100]
lvl.2 [from 100 to 200]
lvl.3 [from 200 to 300]
lvl.4 [from 300 to 500]
lvl.5 [from 500 to 1000].

Scores are assigned based on quality and time of the problem position. As
stated in the frontend, the player must overcome three stages before he can
submit the complete problem position. Each stage is worth 1 point. IF the user
completes the submission before the end of the time, the score is assigned. 
Otherwise, the score is not assigned. They can proceed to the next stage only
after the correct resolution of their current stage. There are extra points for
players who answer fast: so, since any room accepts a maximum of 1000 players,
the first player gains 10 extra points, the players from second to tenth gain
5 extra points, the players from tenth to 100th gain 3 extra points.
The ranking is determined by the score.

**(2.3)**Backend:
Here I will give an overview about the structure of the game data.

2.3.1
Player table updated with the elements from the game logic:

+-----------------+--------------+------------------+--------------+
| player_id(PK)   | player_name  | player_password  | room_num(FK) |
+-----------------+--------------+------------------+--------------+
| 1               | Alice        | not_1234         | none         |
| 2               | Bob          | not_my_birthday  | room_1       |

# philosophical_quiz
A real-time multiplayer quiz game where players can join rooms, answer questions, and see their scores on a leaderboard. This project will cover frontend and backend development, databases, caching, containerization, and version control. This is not a ready-to use app: it's just a learning project. Please, be careful.
